# AIC Presentation

This is a presentation designed for an audience with casual familiarity with machine learning.  This presentation briefly describes one of three projects I've undertaken during my internship with Inte Q.  The other project involved helping build and package a customer segmentation (using k-means).

# Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

Contains 10 programs written in the C++ language in a UNIX environment including:
1) Program 11 - Generates and traverses a weighted directed graph in various ways.
2) Program 10 - Generates a sorted database via hashtables and linear probes.
3) Program 9  - Generates and sorts heap tables in various ways.
4) Program 8  - Generates a binary tree initialized with random integers, and then removes the leaves from the tree until empty.
5) Program 7  - Generates several binary trees and prints some attributes of them.
6) Program 6  - Generates several binary trees and prints their leaves in various orders (inorder, preorder and postorder)
7) Program 5  - Generates a store simulation where customers enter and leave the store.  Various metrics are computed including number of departures, min/max shopping time, average shopping time and total simulation time.  
8) Program 4  - Isolates individual words from user input, cleaning them of non-alphanumeric characters, 
and provide various metrics on the words contained in the input.  
9) Program 3  - Uses a seive algorithm to display all primes up to the integer N, which is given by the user.
10) Program 2 - Sorts random integers based on linear and binary searches and compares percent of successful searches.

# Code For Fractal Diagrams

This code was written in Python 2.7 with weave.inline (for including C++ code to speed up computations) for research purposes.  

# MATLAB Code

Various MATLAB projects are included, including an LU-decomposition algorithm, Newton's Method and Extended Secant Method for finding the zeros of a function, and various other projects.  

#Intermediate C++ Programs
