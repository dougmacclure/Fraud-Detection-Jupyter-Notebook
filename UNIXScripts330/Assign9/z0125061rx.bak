// This program is designed to emulate the Unix command "tee" to a certain
// degree of functionality.  It takes input from standard input (file descriptor 0)
// and copies it into multiple files.  -a allows us to append the files.
// NOTE: This program expects command line arguments.
// COMMAND LINE FORMAT: ./z0125061 [-a] outFile1 [outFile2] [outFile3] ...
