	<p><strong><h2>My Interests:</h2></strong>
	<ol>
		  
		<li><strong>Mathematics.</strong>  I start Graduate School at NIU in the Fall for "Pure" Mathematics.  
		My two favorite aspects of Mathematics are Complex Dynamics, and <a href="#mypic">Fractal Geometry</a>.</li></br>

		<li><strong>Music.</strong>  I love Autechre, Squarepusher, Frank Zappa, and Ariel Pink's Haunted 
		Graffiti.  All highly recommended!  I used to make music, but found out that I enjoy 
		listening to music much more, and I wasn't ever really that good to begin with.</li></br>  

		<li><strong>Cooking.</strong>  As long as it doesn't take more than an hour to make.</li></br>

		<li><strong>Video Games.</strong>  I like to play RPGs mostly.  These days, I've been playing Eve 
		Online and The Witcher 2.</li></br>
	</ol></p>	
	  
	<p><strong><h2>My Favorite Television Shows (in no particular order):</h2></strong>
	<ul>

		<li>Breaking Bad</li>
		<li>Dexter</li>
		<li>Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job</li>
		<li>Twilight Zone</li>


	
	</ul></p>
